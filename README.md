# Mastermind
Mastermind is a classic board game of deduction and strategy that has captivated players since its invention in the 1970s for its simplicity and yet depth of strategy. Created by Mordecai Meirowitz, Mastermind challenges players to crack a secret code composed of colored pegs.

This Mastermind WebApp faithfully recreates the essence of the classic game. The player's objective is to deduce the exact sequence of colors within a limited number of turns to crack the code randomly created by the app.

Each turn, the player makes a guess by placing colored pegs in a row on the board. The app then provides feedback by placing smaller pegs, called 'key pegs,' next to the guess. These key pegs indicate how close the guess is to the secret code:
- A black key peg signifies a correct color in the correct position;
- A gray key peg indicates a correct color but in the wrong position;
- No key peg means that none of the guessed colors are in the secret code.

Through a process of logical deduction and elimination, the player refines their guesses, using the feedback from previous attempts to narrow down the possibilities. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the exact sequence or exhausts their allotted number of turns.

The player requires a combination of logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and a bit of luck to win the game.

This game appeals to a wide range of players, from children acquiring fundamental deduction abilities to experienced strategists refining their mental agility."

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Color Palette__

  - Allows the player to choose the combination of colors to try to crack the secret color code generated by the app.
  - When playing on a computer, the colors scale up when the mouse hovers over them, making the color about to be chosen more evident for a better user experience (UX).
  - The colors are spaced apart sufficiently to prevent accidentally choosing the wrong color when playing the game on smaller devices such as smartphones or tablets.

- __Secret Code Row__

  - The row containing the secret code is hidden behind question marks, enhancing the intuitive understanding for the player that the game revolves around discovering this hidden information.

![Secret row](documentation/guess_row.png)

- __Current Guess Row__

  - The current row being played is marked with dark rings improving visual clarity during gameplay progression.

- __Current Peg__
  - The circles on the gameboard symbolizes the pegs from the classic game as seen from the top.

  - The selected peg (chosen manually by clicking or tapping, or automatically at the start of a new row or when selecting a color for the previous peg) is slightly enlarged, ensuring clear visual distinction from the other pegs and aiding the player in identifying the peg they are coloring.

### Features Left to Implement

  - Choice of Difficulty:
    - The player can select between easy (with fewer color options or without color repetition), medium (the current game setup), and hard (with more colors to choose from or a code consisting of more than four colors).
  - Dark Mode:
    - The gameboard and theme transition to darker colors.
  - Colorblind Mode:
    - Utilizes a combination of colors from colorblind-friendly options, or alternatively, numbers could be used instead of colors for easier identification.
  - Game Accessibility Using the Keyboard:
    - Players can navigate the entire WebApp using keyboard keys to select colors and activate buttons.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

  - As a player, I want to:
    - Be able to easily find the instructions so that I can understand the game.
    - Be able to restart a new game at any time.
    - Easily select the colors I want to pick.
    - Easily be able to change the color of any peg before submitting, but after having chosen the colors of the current row.
    - Understand the result keys after each round without having to check any other place.

## Design

### Color Scheme

- The game is inherently colorful, so I opted for a clean appearance for the game board, selecting a simple yet pleasant and joyful linear gradient for the background.
- Shadow effects were applied to the game elements to provide a sense of depth and enhance the user experience.

### Typography

Google Fonts were utilized to import the selected fonts for use on the website.

The title font, [Madimi One](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif,Display&query=Madimi+One) was selected for its distinctive, stylish, yet simple and readable characteristics.

For the other sections, including the instructions, the font chosen was [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif,Display&query=Barlow+Condensed) for its concise and readable nature, even on small screens.

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for details on all testing conducted.

## Fixed bugs

During the test phase a few bugs were detected and corrected accordingly:

1. The random color generation method permits color repetition, leading to incorrect results when a player's guess includes the same color multiple times. For instance, if a color appears only once in the secret array and one of the repeated colors chosen by the player happens to be correctly placed during the comparison, that color is erroneously counted as many times as it occurred plus one in the result. 
To address this issue, I created a variable to keep track of all indexes had already been compared. For each element of the user's guess (arr2) that was not a perfect match, the fuction would search for its presence in the secret code (arr1) at different positions, checking the array of indexes that have been already checked, ensuring that the current position hasn't already been identified as a perfect match. This is descibed on the JavaScript code as a comment on the function checkResult(arr1, arr2) as well.

2. When the "Start New Game" button was pressed, the active row wasn't the first row, but rather the one that was last played before pressing the button. This issue was fixed by implementing a "resetGame" function to delete configurations saved on the last played pegs.

3. When the game started with a page reload, only the pegs on the current row were clickable, which was the intended behavior. However, after losing or playing until a certain row and restarting with the "Start New Game" button, the pegs of the previously played rows did not lose the ".selected" class and could also be chosen to be played with. To fix this issue, I added reassignments for variables that stored values to reset them in the function that runs after clicking on "Submit".

4. The pegs on the previously played rows retained the selected class on them. To address this, I had to remove the event listener on the "moveToNextRow" function.

5. After winning, the color sequence was revealed, but the last played row remained active, and I could still press "Submit". Similarly, after losing, the same issue occurs, and I could still play. This issue was fixed by creating a "gameOver" function that removes attributes from the "guess pegs".

6. After cleaning up and restructuring the code, an issue arose where the first "peg" of the current row wouldn't hold the "selected" class attribute, which allows for visualization of the active peg. To fix this, a thorough analysis of the entire code was conducted. It was discovered that the attribute was being added by one function but removed by setting some variables to clear upon moving to the next row. The fix was to move the function that handles the addition of the class attribute to the bottom of the tasks within the function that checks if the game proceeds after comparing the arrays. This ensured it was placed underneath the tasks that clear up the configurations on previous played "pegs".

## Unfixed Bugs

As of the current date of this documentation, to the best of my knowledge, there are no unresolved bugs.
