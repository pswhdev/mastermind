# Mastermind
Mastermind is a classic board game of deduction and strategy that has captivated players since its invention in the 1970s for its simplicity and yet depth of strategy. Created by Mordecai Meirowitz, Mastermind challenges players to crack a secret code composed of colored pegs.

This Mastermind WebApp faithfully recreates the essence of the classic game. The player's objective is to deduce the exact sequence of colors within a limited number of turns to crack the code randomly created by the app.

Each turn, the player makes a guess by placing colored pegs in a row on the board. The app then provides feedback by placing smaller pegs, called 'key pegs,' next to the guess. These key pegs indicate how close the guess is to the secret code:
- A black key peg signifies a correct color in the correct position;
- A gray key peg indicates a correct color but in the wrong position;
- No key peg means that none of the guessed colors are in the secret code.

Through a process of logical deduction and elimination, the player refines their guesses, using the feedback from previous attempts to narrow down the possibilities. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the exact sequence or exhausts their allotted number of turns.

The player requires a combination of logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and a bit of luck to win the game.

This game appeals to a wide range of players, from children acquiring fundamental deduction abilities to experienced strategists refining their mental agility."

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Color Palette__

  - Allows the player to choose the combination of colors to try to crack the secret color code generated by the app.
  - When playing on a computer, the colors scale up when the mouse hovers over them, making the color about to be chosen more evident for a better user experience (UX).
  - The colors are spaced apart sufficiently to prevent accidentally choosing the wrong color when playing the game on smaller devices such as smartphones or tablets.

- __Current Peg__
  - The circles on the gameboard symbolizes the pegs from the classic game as seen from the top.

  - The selected peg (chosen manually by clicking or tapping, or automatically at the start of a new row or when selecting a color for the previous peg) is slightly enlarged, ensuring clear visual distinction from the other pegs and aiding the player in identifying the peg they are coloring.

- __Result keys__ 

  - The result panel, displaying the computed keys, is aligned with the guess row for clear interpretation of the provided results. It consists of four small circles, symbolizing the little pegs used as keys in the classic game when viewed from above.

    - The gameboard and theme transition to darker colors.
  - Colorblind Mode:
    - Utilizes a combination of colors from colorblind-friendly options, or alternatively, numbers could be used instead of colors for easier identification.

    - Players can navigate the entire WebApp using keyboard keys to select colors and activate buttons.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

  - As a traveler planning a trip to Rio de Janeiro:
    - I want to easily find and book accommodation so I can have a comfortable place to stay during my visit.
    - I want to view high-quality photos of the apartment, so I can decide if it is a place I would like to stay.
    - I want to access practical information about the surrounding area to help plan my activities during my stay.
    - I want to easily find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) such as check-in process, and policies.


## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the chosen picture to be featured on the front page as the basis for selecting the color theme for the website. To accomplish this, I utilized the [Adobe Colors - Extract Theme](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) tool.

- I have maintained consistency throughout the website by following the same color scheme, ensuring a pleasant user experience. The colors used were:
  - #023859 for the background color of the body.
  - #f2e4dc for the text color on the body and footer, as well as for the background color of the header (logo and navigation menu).
  - #0d0d0d for the text color of the header (logo and navigation menu) and footer.

### Typography

Google Fonts were utilized to import the selected fonts for use on the website.

- [DM Serif Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display?query=dm+serif) was used for the headings for being a good contrasting font to be used in combination with [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Raleway), which was chosen for the rest of the text content due to its sleek and modern design, as well as its excellent readability.
 - For the headings, Verdana was chosen as a browser-safe font, while Arial was used for the body text. Sans-serif was designated as the fallback font for both.

### Imagery

Since the website serves as an advertisement for an accommodation located at Pepe Beach, I aimed for a photo specifically showcasing this area of Rio. This decision was made deliberately to accurately represent the accommodation's location and to highlight the unique atmosphere offered by Pepe Beach, distinct from the internationally renowned Copacabana and Ipanema beaches.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were initially created for both mobile and desktop versions using Balsamiq. However, during the website development process adjustments were made resulting in alterations to the layout and the number of pages. As a result, the wireframes do not perfectly match the final product, but they served as a foundational guide throughout the development process.

## Desktop wireframes:

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for details on all testing conducted.

## Fixed bugs
During the test phase a few bugs were detected and corrected accordingly:
1. The logo and the logo text initially didn't align nicely. After attempting various approaches, the issue was resolved by utilizing `position: relative;` and defining the distance to the bottom using `bottom: 16px;` for the logo's text.
2. The nav toggle showed the same misalignment and the same approach was used to fix it.
3. The mountain on the homepage's image would be cropped on very large screens (1600px) and didn't look as good. To address this issue, a media query was implemented specifically for very large screens, adjusting the height of the image to ensure optimal display.
4. The background color of the containers in the reasons section, the containers grouping the photos on the accommodation page, the container of the form on the contact page and the one enclosing the message on the "thank you" page, didn't offer enough contrast, making the text difficult to read. To address this issue, the transparency was reduced, creating more contrast while still maintaining a visually pleasing appearance on the pages.
5. The embedded Google Maps did not cover the width of the page. The solution to this issue was to apply a CSS rule to the iframe element, setting its width to 100%.
6. The photos on the accommodation page did not display nicely on larger screens. To address this issue, the order of the room's photos was adjusted using the CSS "order" property.
7. During the Mid-Point Project Review call with my mentor, it was noted that the contact us form could be submitted with an empty space in the First Name and Last Name fields, despite the "required" property being present in the input elements. After researching online for a solution, the following solution was found on the  [Stackoverflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13766015/is-it-possible-to-configure-a-required-field-to-ignore-white-space) and the following attributes were added to the input elements: `required pattern=".*\S+.*" title="This field is required"`.
8. The navigation menu was not nicely aligned when the site was visited using the Mozilla Firefox browser.

![Nav menu problem](documentation/nav-menu-firefox-problem.png)

To resolve this issue, a new CSS rule was applied to the nav-menu selector, `align-self: flex-end;`:

![Nav menu problem](documentation/nav-menu-firefox-fixed.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

1. The solution implemented for problem 7 cannot be applied to the "textarea" element, allowing the form to be submitted without a message. As of now, no solution has been found using HTML alone. It's likely that additional programming, such as JavaScript, would be necessary to address this issue.
