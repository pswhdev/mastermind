# Mastermind
Mastermind is a classic board game of deduction and strategy that has captivated players since its invention in the 1970s for its simplicity and yet depth of strategy. Created by Mordecai Meirowitz, Mastermind challenges players to crack a secret code composed of colored pegs.

This Mastermind WebApp faithfully recreates the essence of the classic game. The player's objective is to deduce the exact sequence of colours within a limited number of turns to crack the code randomly created by the app.

Each turn, the player makes a guess by placing colored pegs in a row on the board. The app then provides feedback by placing smaller pegs, called 'key pegs,' next to the guess. These key pegs indicate how close the guess is to the secret code:
- A black key peg signifies a correct color in the correct position;
- A gray key peg indicates a correct color but in the wrong position;
- No key peg means that none of the guessed colours are in the secret code.

Through a process of logical deduction and elimination, the player refines their guesses, using the feedback from previous attempts to narrow down the possibilities. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the exact sequence or exhausts their allotted number of turns.

The player requires a combination of logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and a bit of luck to win the game.

This game appeals to a wide range of players, from children acquiring fundamental deduction abilities to experienced strategists refining their mental agility."

### Existing Features

- __Color Palette__

  - Allows the player to choose the combination of colours to try to crack the secret color code generated by the app.
  - When playing on a computer, the colours scale up when the mouse hovers over them, making the color about to be chosen more evident for a better user experience (UX).
  - The colours are spaced apart sufficiently to prevent accidentally choosing the wrong color when playing the game on smaller devices such as smartphones or tablets.

- __Secret Code Row__

  - The row containing the secret code is hidden behind question marks, enhancing the intuitive understanding for the player that the game revolves around discovering this hidden information.

![Secret row](documentation/secretrow.png)

- __Current Guess Row__

- __Current Peg__
  - The circles on the gameboard symbolizes the pegs from the classic game as seen from the top.

  - The selected peg (chosen manually by clicking or tapping, or automatically at the start of a new row or when selecting a color for the previous peg) is slightly enlarged, ensuring clear visual distinction from the other pegs and aiding the player in identifying the peg they are coloring.

- __Result keys__ 

  - The result panel, displaying the computed keys, is aligned with the guess row for clear interpretation of the provided results. It consists of four small circles, symbolizing the little pegs used as keys in the classic game when viewed from above.

- __Keys Interpretation Panel__

  - A concise panel for interpreting keys is displayed on the screen, eliminating the need for players to refer to the instructions, which is particularly helpful for first-time players.

### Features Left to Implement

  - Choice of Difficulty:
    - The player can select between easy (with fewer color options or without color repetition), medium (the current game setup), and hard (with more colours to choose from or a code consisting of more than four colours).
  - Dark Mode:
    - The gameboard and theme transition to darker colours.
  - Colorblind Mode:
    - Utilizes a combination of colours from colorblind-friendly options, or alternatively, numbers could be used instead of colours for easier identification.
  - Game Accessibility Using the Keyboard:
    - Players can navigate the entire WebApp using keyboard keys to select colours and activate buttons.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

  - As a player, I want to:
    - Be able to easily find the instructions so that I can understand the game.
    - Be able to restart a new game at any time.
    - Easily select the colours I want to pick.
    - Easily be able to change the color of any peg before submitting, but after having chosen the colours of the current row.
    - Understand the result keys after each round without having to check any other place.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- The game is inherently colorful, so I opted for a clean appearance for the game board, selecting a simple yet pleasant and joyful linear gradient for the background.
- Shadow effects were applied to the game elements to provide a sense of depth and enhance the user experience.

### Typography

Google Fonts were utilized to import the selected fonts for use on the website.

The title font, [Madimi One](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif,Display&query=Madimi+One) was selected for its distinctive, stylish, yet simple and readable characteristics.

For the other sections, including the instructions, the font chosen was [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Serif,Display&query=Barlow+Condensed) for its concise and readable nature, even on small screens.
